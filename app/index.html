        --'Back in the day' slow and steady heavyweight delivery diagram-- <br /><br />
        --Continuous delivery diagram (no containers -- dev, testing, stage and prod environments are separate)--<br /><br />
        --Continuous delivery with containers diagram. One container is passed from the developers to Ops, to the testers, to ops who makes duplicates
        that are shared with various stakeholders who are not happy. Package is sent back to dev and loops again. This process takes a lot of time.
        When testers fail a container, the dev team doesn't know about it. The diagram is littered with lots of company
        names that devs might recognize. Lots of people involved and miscommunication.--<br /><br />
        --The wonderous final state, which is like the previous one but with several pieces grayed out because we take care of it for you. A nicely simplified
        diagram. Stakeholders of course are happy when they see the code. The container, though it might get replaced here and there as code is updated
        (containers' code is read-only, and must be destroyed and re-created if its code is updated), one container eventually becomes production code,
        living in peaceful co-existence with other containers.--
